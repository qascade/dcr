# GSSoC'23 Guidelines 

This documents have basic guidelines that are to followed during the GSSoC'23. 

Please make sure to go through the Spec Docs and the introductory video before starting on any issue. Both the links are present on the [Readme](/README.md)

I (@qascade) will personally mentor/guide you through the PR if you chose any of the hard tasks.ðŸ˜„

Each of the following guidelines are subject to change/bend on the discretion of code owners only. 

## Guidelines: 

1. Each issue can only have one assignee at a time, but the assignment is subject to rules. 
2. Issues around docs/CI Flows/Project Contributing Conventions are only to be released/updated by project owners themselves, if/when deemed necessary. Rest will be closed automatically. 
In general, docs are to updated according the context of PR Title.
3. Each Issue will have `beginner-friendly`, `medium` and `hard` tag. This will be helpful in chosing an issue as per your expertise. In addition to that I have added `differential-privacy` and `confidential-computing` tag to differentiate between the underlying concept required. 
4. For `differential-privacy` issues you should throughly understand how Google's Differential Privacy Library works. 
5. For `confidential-computing` issues you should understand how Intel SGX enclaves behave and work. You can look at the [E-Go](https://github.com/edgelesssys/ego) docs for the same. For additional resources you can look at Confidential Computing Consortium Refs at the end of README.md
6. A `beginner-friendly` task will be unassigned on inactivity of 24 hrs. 
7. A `medium` task will be unassigned on inactivity over 3 days. 
8. A `hard` task will be unassigned, if you are inactive for over 7 days.

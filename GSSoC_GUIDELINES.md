# GSSoC'23 Guidelines 

This documents have basic guidelines that are to followed during the GSSoC'23. 

Please make sure to go through the Spec Docs and the introductory video before starting on any issue. Both the links are present on the [Readme](/README.md)

I (@qascade) will personally mentor/guide you through the PR if you chose any of the hard tasks.üòÑ

Each of the following guidelines are subject to change/bend on the discretion of code owners only. 

## For Beginners:

1. Some References to get familiar with Go :
    - [Go By Examples](https://gobyexample.com/)
    - [Effective Go doc](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
    - [learn TDD with Go](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)
    - [Debugging with delve](https://youtu.be/a1SneuI65O0_)
    - [Testing All the things playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtFquUj7IL8VpSL98BTvl3lnD8HS4NGlA)
       
2. YAML Ref: https://github.com/qascade/YAML-Notes 
3. To Learn Git: 
    - Missing Sem MIT Version Control: https://youtu.be/2sjqTHE0zok 
    - https://ohshitgit.com
    - How to become git experts: https://youtu.be/hZS96dwKvt0
    - Git Internals (optional): https://youtu.be/lG90LZotrpo 

Pick up a beginner-friendly project and start contributing. Make sure to read all the guidelines as well as the spec docs of the project. You can start with the issues related to theory stuff well, if you are interested, which I highly encourage you to do. Mostly of them are under `medium/hard` category.

## Guidelines: 

1. Each issue can only have one assignee at a time, but the assignment is subject to rules. 
2. Issues around docs/CI Flows/Project Contributing Conventions are only to be released/updated by project owners themselves, if/when deemed necessary. Rest will be closed automatically. 
In general, docs are to updated according the context of PR Title.
3. Each Issue will have `beginner-friendly`, `medium` and `hard` tag. This will be helpful in chosing an issue as per your expertise. In addition to that I have added `differential-privacy` and `confidential-computing` tag to differentiate between the underlying concept required. 
4. For `differential-privacy` issues you should throughly understand how Google's Differential Privacy Library works. 
5. For `confidential-computing` issues you should understand how Intel SGX enclaves behave and work. You can look at the [E-Go](https://github.com/edgelesssys/ego) docs for the same. For additional resources you can look at Confidential Computing Consortium Refs at the end of README.md
6. A `beginner-friendly` task will be unassigned on inactivity of 24 hrs. This PR should hardly take 2-3 days. These tasks are good to learn about git/github eco-system but won't make you good software developer. 
7. A `medium` task will be unassigned on inactivity over 3 days. This PR should take around 7-10 days to complete. This will help you learn how to dabble a large code base.
8. A `hard` task will be unassigned, if you are inactive for over 7 days. This PR will take around 30 days to complete but will be much more meaningful. If you want to apply CS Concepts that you learn in your class in real-life these are the issues you should aim for. 

Looking forward to some meaningful contributions and collaborations. 

Wishing you the Best of Luck!!üöÄ
